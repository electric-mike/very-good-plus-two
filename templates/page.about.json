In contrast to premium themes, VG+ was built by our team of experts with UX\/UI design best practices and on Shopify Online Store 2.0, leveraging the best technology for optimum performance. It serves as the foundation to scale with you. <\/p><p>Although premium themes may seem easier on the budget, they may cost you in the long run from drawbacks and limitations. The versatility of a premium theme might seem great at first glance, but \"under the hood\" it comes with bloated code and more things to load on your site. The more things loading on your site, the slower it performs. We circumvent those issues with VG+ serving as our starting point with performance in mind and we tailor the rest specifically for your business.<\/p>",
